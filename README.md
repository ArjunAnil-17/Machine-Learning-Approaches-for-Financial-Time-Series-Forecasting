# Machine-Learning-Approaches-for-Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting
In this project we are using supervised machine learning algorithms like SVM, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest etc. for time series forecasting. Forecasting time series data is an important task for brokers, financial analysts and traders as they make decisions daily about buying financial assets. Hence knowing the market factors beforehand helps in minimizing loss. The features for the model are past observations in time series data. One step ahead technique was used for creating target features. The dataset consists of closing prices from NASDAQ, SP500, Bitcoin & Ethereum, USD-EUR exchange prices. The performance of the models indicate its capability to use it for time series tasks.
